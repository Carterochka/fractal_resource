            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Fractals are mesmerizing, infinitely complex patterns that display self-similarity across various scales.
                They are mathematical constructs characterized by their intricate and recursive structures, making them
                a captivating subject of study. The term "fractal" was introduced by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975,
                originating from the Latin word "fractus," which means "broken" or "fractured." Fractals exhibit unique
                properties, such as fractional dimensions, recursion, and infinite complexity.</p>
            <p>In mathematics, fractals provide insights into chaotic systems and help visualize complex geometries.
                They serve as a bridge between order and chaos, allowing us to understand the underlying patterns in
                seemingly random systems.</p>
            <p>Nature is abundant with fractal patterns, from the arrangement of leaves on a plant to the branching of
                trees and the intricate design of snowflakes. These patterns enable nature to optimize various
                processes, such as nutrient distribution and space utilization. Fractals in nature often exhibit a high
                degree of efficiency and resilience.</p>
            <p>In digital art, fractals have revolutionized the way artists and designers create visually stunning and
                intricate designs. They enable the generation of highly detailed, scalable images with a relatively
                simple set of rules. Fractal-based techniques are widely used in computer graphics, special effects, and
                animation, making the seemingly impossible a reality.</p>
            <p>Join us as we delve into the fascinating world of fractals, exploring their properties, their presence in
                mathematics and nature, and their significant impact on digital art. Let's embark on a journey to unveil
                the endless patterns of infinity.</p>

            <h2>What are Fractals?</h2>
            <p>Fractals are a unique class of geometric shapes characterized by their intricate patterns and recursive
                structures. These remarkable shapes possess several key features, which distinguish them from
                traditional Euclidean geometry:</p>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="fractal-features-list">
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Self-similarity: Fractals exhibit self-similarity, meaning their patterns repeat at
                                different
                                scales. This repetition can be either exact, where the same pattern reappears
                                identically,
                                or
                                approximate, where the pattern appears similar but with slight variations.
                                Self-similarity
                                allows fractals to maintain their defining characteristics, irrespective of the scale at
                                which
                                they are viewed.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Infinite detail: Fractals possess infinite complexity, revealing increasingly intricate
                                patterns
                                as one zooms in closer. This property implies that fractals can be explored
                                indefinitely,
                                always
                                uncovering new levels of detail without reaching a finite limit.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Fractional dimensions: Unlike traditional geometric shapes, which have integer dimensions
                                (e.g.,
                                a line has one dimension, a square has two dimensions), fractals often exhibit
                                fractional
                                dimensions. This characteristic measures the complexity of a fractal, capturing its
                                space-filling properties and the degree of self-similarity it exhibits.</p>

            <p>Fractals can be found all around us, unveiling the elegant patterns and structures that underpin the
                natural world. They appear in various forms and scales, showcasing the harmonious interplay between
                order and chaos. Fractals in nature often exhibit high efficiency and resilience, optimizing processes
                such as nutrient distribution, space utilization, and energy conservation.</p>

                        Similarly,

            <h2>Fractal Mathematics</h2>
            <p>Fractal mathematics encompasses the study of intricate, self-similar patterns that emerge from simple
                mathematical rules. It transcends traditional Euclidean geometry, delving into the realm of fractional
                dimensions and infinite complexity. Fractals offer a glimpse into the fascinating interplay between
                order and chaos, providing insights into diverse fields such as chaos theory, dynamical systems, and
                number theory. </p>

            <p>Now, I imagine that some of you might not have read the resource that I linked earlier with a lot of
                attention, or might have gotten confused by the process of creating fractals. So let's go through it
                again, as it is important to understand this process for the further activities. We will work through
                the algorithm using Koch's Curve as an example. <i>Note that right below the algorithm there is a
                    carousel with visualizations of the first few steps! :)</i></p>

            <p>Here is how we create Koch's Curve:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Draw a straight line. <i>(Picture 1 in carousel below.)</i></li>
                <li>Apply the following transformation to this line:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Starting from the left, draw a line of the length of the original line divided by 3;</li>
                        <li>Turn anticlockwise by 60°;</li>
                        <li>Draw another line of the same length as the previous one in this direction;</li>
                        <li>Turn clockwise by 120°;</li>
                        <li>Draw another line of the same length as the previous one in this direction;</li>
                        <li>Turn anticlockwise by 60°;</li>
                        <li>Draw the final line of the same length as the previous one in this direction.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Congrats! You moved to the second order fractal. <i>(Picture 2 in carousel below.)</i> Now, you have
                    4 lines instead of 1.</li>
                <li>For each of these new lines, go ahead and apply the same transformation described above. By
                    recursively doing it, you will obtain a higher-order curve (i.e. increase a fractional dimension,
                    <i>keep scrolling the carousel below to see</i>).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Draw Fractals by Hand</h2>
            <p>Now that you know the algorithmic approach behind creating fractals, try drawing them by yourself using
                only pen and paper (or tablet). Make it interesting - don't draw the Koch's Curve again :) Here are some other simple fractals you can attempt to draw (but feel free to explore others too!):</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Sierpinski Triangle;</li>
                <li>Levy C Curve;</li>
                <li>Pythagoras tree.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A good point to start would be to ask google about what it is. If you are really stuck and don't know how
                to draw these - remember about your old good ChatGPT friend! :O</p>

            <p>Be creative! After drawing a few first iterations, you can try to "decorate" your fractal by adding some
                nice elements, colors, and styles to it. While the purpose of this exercise is to understand how digital
                advances allowed usage of fractals in the art, it doesn't mean that the process should not be creative
                and fun!</p>

            <p>Fractals have also found applications in various domains, including computer-generated imagery (CGI), special effects, and video games. More specifically: </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI): In the movie "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" (1982), fractals were used to generate the "Genesis effect," a computer-generated sequence that showcased the terraforming of a barren planet. This was one of the first instances of fractals being used in CGI to create realistic landscapes and terrains. <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3584"><i>See here if you are interested to learn more.</i></a></li>
                <li>Special Effects: The creation of realistic and intricate fire effects in movies often involves the use of fractal-based algorithms. One example is the film "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" (2002), where fractal-based techniques were employed to simulate the dynamic, chaotic behavior of fire during the battle sequences. <i><a href="https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2704&context=all_theses">This article</a> (long one though) can give you more insight on this.</i></li>
                <li>Video Games: Fractals have been used to procedurally generate complex terrains and landscapes in video games, providing a realistic and immersive gaming experience. An example is the game "No Man's Sky" (2016), which uses fractal algorithms to generate diverse and vast procedurally generated planets, offering players virtually endless exploration possibilities. <i>If this sounds dope, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ORcSjvESrA">here is a cool video</a> that explains the usage of fractals in this game.</i></li>
            </ol>
            
            <p></p>Fractals have been instrumental in the development of highly detailed, realistic, and dynamic visuals that have transformed the way we experience digital media. Fractal-based techniques are widely used in terrain generation, texture synthesis, procedural modeling of natural objects, and the simulation of natural phenomena, such as clouds and fire. An example of fractals in CGI can be seen in the creation of realistic landscapes and terrains in movies and video games, where fractal algorithms are employed to generate intricate, natural-looking environments.</p>

            <h2>Creating Fractal Art with Python</h2>
            <p>It wouldn't be me if there was no coding exercise in this resource. Don't worry though - I tried to make it extremely easy. The only goal that I am trying to achieve is to give you some understanding about how exactly programming tools can be used to generate fractal art.</p>

            <p>Your task here will be very simple. Choose some simple fractal and ask ChatGPT to write you a Python code to draw it. Copy paste the generated code into the code box below and press run. Observe how this code is being executed. Your task is to have some basic understanding of how the code works - and the algorithm that I described in <a href="#mathematics">"Draw Fractals by Hand"</a> section should be help you a lot here. Something you may notice is that it starts drawing in some weird part of the canvas, in such a way that part of the drawing is invisible. Try to fix it - this will be your challenging part of the work :)</p>

            <p>Note that the Python interpreter below is pretty basic. It supports `Turtle` library, but will most likely fail to execute code that involves `numpy` or `matplotlib`. That is why I ask you to focus on drawing simple fractals.</p>

            <p>The code box below is pre-filled with the Koch's Snowflake code that ChatGPT generated for me. You can start by running this code first!</p>
